## Why redesign?

In early 2020, Mail Shark’s homepage design was 3 years old. In the 3 years since the existing homepage went live, the marketing department (which included myself) made great progress with evolving Mail Shark’s brand to be a more focused and cohesive experience. The homepage of Mail Shark’s website was falling behind the brand.

The existing homepage felt disconnected from the newer website pages: it was text heavy and used a disjointed combination of icon styles and photography. As UI/UX Designer at Mail Shark, I was responsible for planning, designing, and prototyping an updated homepage which would reflect Mail Shark’s brand in 2020.

## Planning

### Stakeholder meeting

I first meet with the President of Mail Shark, the Marketing VP, and the Creative Manager to discuss the goals, features, and tone of the new homepage. 

In short, the content on the existing page was adequate, however, it needed to be organized to include less text and include updated brand components.

#### Goals

1. Provide a concise description of the company and easily provide a way to learn more
2. Show the user why Mail Shark is better than the competition
3. Tie the brand together with a uniform, user-friendly, mobile accessible design

## Developing the prototype

After the design was completed, I developed a prototype to further show the effectiveness of the new components, layout, and branding. Although Adobe XD has powerful prototyping features, I wanted to develop the prototype with web technology as coding practice.

### Technology used

- React
- Styled components
